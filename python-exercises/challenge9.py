CHAIN REACTION GAME:
The player has to make a set of choices to create a successful chain reaction to complete the game (you choose the context). When the player commences the chain reaction, the reaction may not complete its course if a setting is incorrect on the way. There should be at least three settings on the way. You decide how much assistance the player will have in printed text.

EXTENSIONS:
Give the player more than two options for each link in the chain
Playerâ€™s number of lives (goes) is limited; if they make too many wrong selections of choices that result in the chain not being complete, the game is over.
Multi-player; who can complete the chain first with the least number of goes/settings!
