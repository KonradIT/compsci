##Organize Von Neumann PC Steps

5. The address part of the instruction is placed in the MAR (memory address register)
1. The PC (program counter) contains the address of the next instruction to be fetched
6. The instruction is finally decoded and is then executed
4. The entire instruction is then copied from the MDR (memory data register) and placed in the CIR (current instruction register)
7. The value in the PC (program counter) is then incremented so that it points to the next instruction to be fetched
2. The address contained in the PC (program counter) is copied to the MAR (memory address register) via the address bus
3. The instruction is then copied from the memory location contained in the MAR (memory address register) and is placed in the MDR (memory data register)

a) **What does clock speed determine?**

How much the computer can “do”, such as process information.

Example: The higher the clock speed, the better the games[.](http://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace)

b) **The higher the clock speed…**

The better the games

c) **What is the purpose of the vibrating crystal in a clock?**

Generate a precise frequency

d) **What happens in a computer each time the clock ticks?**

e) **What is clock speed measured in?**

Herz

a) **What does a core do with an instruction? **

A chip that does basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O)

b) **How many cores can a computer have? **

The more the better, my phone has 4 cores, my watch has 2.

c) **How does the number of cores affect the rate of fetching and executing instructions?**

The more the cores, the higher the rate

a) **Where can you find the CPU cache?**

/cache (between cores and RAM)

b) **What does a CPU check first? Main memory or cache? Why?**

Cache

c) **The bigger the cache...**

The faster the execution

d) **Multicore processors normally have a separate cache for each core. TRUE or FALSE?**

TRUE
