##Computer sensors

What to measure:

* Light
* Sound
* Colors
* Radiation
* Magnetism
* Orientation
* Rotation
* Pressure
* Speed
* Temperature

*Why measure these?*

To know the weather forecast, to know at what speed is this object going, to avoid getting into radiation zones, also detect fires and control greenhouses, etc...

*Why use computers to do measurements?*

Computers can do very precise measurements, and reduce the margin of error a lot. They can also repeat this a lot of time.
