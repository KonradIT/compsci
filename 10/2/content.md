#Length check

Length check is the validation that checks if the length of the string/int/etc... is "appropiate" for the process. Eg: [a password textbox](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/InputType.html) may check if the length of the password is equal or more than 8 characters (8 is a common secure length for passwords).

It can also be used for content, such as:

* **[tweets](http://twitter.com)**
* **postal addresses**, for instance a Spanish postal address is 5 characters long (eg: 28200)
* **telephone numbers**, for instance Spanish telephone numbers are 9 characters long (eg: 666 666 666)
* **avoid crapposting**, a very short post in a board site, eg Blogspot or 4chan can usually lead to spam or [sh*tpost](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shitpost)
