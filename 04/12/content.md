##Table

Hardware VS Software

**Hardware**:

* Screen
* Keyboard
* Mouse

All equipment needed which is physical

**Software**:

Compiled code such as an OS or a program

###Sensors

Light, temperature, movement sensor, gyro/compass (magnetometer)

CO2 sensor, pressure, moisture and humidity, pH

---

###Keyboard

1) **What would the speed of input be like if you were trained with this device?**

Speedy

2) **Is there much complexity to using this device?**

There is for the elderly 

3) **What could go wrong as an end user is typing?**

He/she types ````rm -rf /```` and hits the enter key

4) **What would the speed of input be like if you were not trained with this device?**

very slo

###Mouse

1) **is it quick to scroll from one side to another?**

Yes

2) **Is there a lot of effort in moving a mouse device?**

Sometimes

3) **What type of surface does an end user require to move a mouse on?**

A mouse mat, specifically [this one](http://36.media.tumblr.com/2c3a5b917be2686888a0ccfed94b601c/tumblr_o4x6tiXkaR1qdl9ybo1_1280.jpg)

4) **What could go wrong with the roller ball or laser from a mouse device?**

Rollerball? Is this 2002?

The laser emitter can get dust

###Scanner

1) **What will happen to the available memory on your computer when a scan is done?**

The available memory will decrease, depending on the scanner parameters such as image quality and bit rate it can take little or lot of space

2) **Should the images you scan be high quality and why?**

The better the quality, the less the image will be pixelated

3) **How can you move scanned images stored on your computer?**

You can manipulate them like normal .tiff/.tga/.png files, click and drag!

###3D Scanner

**Make a list of what unique physical features can be scanned from a human. **

The color the eyes, the height, the color of the skin, the distance from the eyes to the nose

###Barcodes

* Black vertical bars, with white vertical bars in between, are scanned by barcode reader
* A sensor detects light reflected back from the barcode
* The light signal received is an analogue signal
* Sensor converts analogue signal to a digital signal
* Sensor decodes the digital signal into a number that can represent an item, e.g. milk bought at a supermarket

* Analogue Signal: continuous signal for which the time varying feature (variable)
* Digital Signal:  digital signal with only two possible values 1 or 0
* Sensor: detects information from physical world

| ADVANTAGES                                   | DISADVANTAGES                              |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Very efficient method of finding out data of an entry | Scan may not be possible if barcode is dim |
| Can be used to keep record of sales levels for a product | Barcode data needs to be scanned in a computer otherwise the barcodescanner canâ€™t identify the entity being scanned |



###QR: Throwback to 2012

Consist of several black squares, including three big ones positioned in corners

While normal barcodes are onedimensional; storing data in a single line of black and white bars, qr codes are 2D; storing data both vertically and horizontally in several squares.

Normal barcodes can store approximately 30 different numbers whereas qr codes can store around 7000.

A QR code reader is used to scan the data on the (QR) code, which can be used to store data or links to specific Internet content.

You can make your own QR codes online with a generator!


Very efficient at storing and linking information

Smartphone is required for scanning

Code can still be read even if it is partially obsfucated

Not as common as barcode

Can store a variety of _ _ _ o _ _ a _ _ _ _ including website links, videos, images and messages
