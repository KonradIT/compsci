#SVG images

Pixels make up bitmaps

Pixels - The smallest possible addressable section in an image file defined by a solid colour and represented as a single bit in binary.

Image Resolution - The number of pixels per inch/cm in an image

Screen 8000

63825

8487000

PIXEL: the smallest possible addressable area defined by a solid colour, represented as binary, in an image

HEADER: contains information about the type, size, and layout of a file

Img res: how many pixels an image contains per inch/cm

Screenres:  the number of pixels per row by the number of pixels per column

Height (45), Width (65) = 

Image Resolution (600), Width (40) = 15

Height (80), Image Resolution (1000) = 12.5

Drawbacks of high image res:

More computer storage space required

Longer time to transfer image over net

Colour Depth (2), Image Size (650) = 325 (npixels)

Image Size (640), Number of Pixels (40) = 16 (color depth)

Number of Pixels (780), Colour Depth (24) = 18720 (image size)

16

2^16

File size:

Image Height (pixels) * Image Width (pixels) * Color Depth (bits)= file size

390000 b = 390 kb

1170000 b = 1.1 kb

4680000 b = 4.68 mb

Quiz:

How many bits does the colour depth have to be if we want to store 8 colours per pixel?

3

How many bits would an image be that has a size of 90 by 150 pixels, with each pixel able to display 16 colours?

90*150*4=54000 b

When advantage does a computer user have of decreasing the colour depth for an image?

Less storage required

There are images that are defined by using maths and geometry such as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygons. The use o these shapes enables scalability without affecting image quality. object and properties are stored mathematically. They are not based on real photographs as they are computer generated.

drawing object: Vector graphics are made up of objects and their properties. An object is a mathematical or geometrically 
defined construct such as a rectangle, line or circle.

- Property: Each of these objects has properties to tell you the size, colour, position etc. Take a look at the next example to - see how drawing lists are built from objects and properties.
- drawing list: a set of commands used to define a vector image
