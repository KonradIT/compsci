##Digital Camera

Encodes digital images and videos for storage in memory or on an SD (Standard Digital) card.
Images are recorded by a sensor called the Charge-Coupled Device (CCD).
A camera on a mobile phone can record images of at least 3 megapixels (1 megapixel = 1 million pixels). Professional cameras can capture images of at least 16 megapixels in size.
The higher the number of pixels in an image, the greater the quality of the image.

| Images taken are instantly stored, enabling end user to quickly decide for a retake or not | A camera with a low number of pixels results in low quality images                                    |
| Shared digital copies can be made of images                                                | Images can be shared with other users by mistake                                                      |
| Digital copies of images are easily shareable                                              | High storage capacities or SD cards are required for several images or ones comprising of many pixels |
| Digital copies of images can be edited with computer software                              |                                                                                                       |

##Touch Screen

Combines liquid crystal display with touch-sensitive sensors for the functions of screen buttons, drop-down menus and virtual keyboard.
Users can switch between applications, rotate images, increase or decrease zoom on a file and draw images with fingers or stylus.
capacitive screens don’t recognise gloves touching; it requires natural electrical signals from humans.
resistive screens do recognise gloves touching; it is made of multiple layers with ____ in between to detect the slightest pressure

##Interactive Whiteboards

Similar to touchscreens
Connected to a computer via SBU(serial bus universal)(wait wat)
Computer’s visual display is projected onto the board, which is calibrated (adjusted), so that sensors line up with the displayed image
Sensors can help determine what part of the board is being selected in application selection, handwriting or text input.

| Versatile - can write on, drawn on as well as display existing images and text | Touches may not be recognised if collaboration doesn’t occur properly |
| Large size and wow so effect for use in large groups/classrooms                | precise and so very suitable for work with complex details            |

##Microphone

An analogue input device that records sound
An analogue-to-digital converter converts the analogue sound wave into the digital form required for computer storage
Microphones can be used for readable tasks, where the end user speaks and computer software translates this into speech-to-text visual text
In-game speech and other speech inputs for smart television control and usage are also made possible with microphones.

| Enables the use of speech-recognition                                      | Sound may not be accurately recorded                                      |
| Disabled end users with hand and finger impairment can use audio equipment | End users require training with speech-recognition systems prior to usage |
