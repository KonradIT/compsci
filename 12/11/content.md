* Why are certain numbers used in LMC? Eg: 901

* There is an input device, probably a keyboard since it requires to input a number or maybe a joystick or a light sensor. There is also an arithmetic unit, feels very 80s, There is of course a Random Access Memory with 99 blocks. And a CPU with a program counter, a address/instructions register and a accummulator. There is an Output, probably a screen.
* The program counter counts the number of time main fnc is ran. The input gets user data, the RAM stores bytes, the output displays the data.
* Those are RAM addresses
