###Pseudocode 

The code assigns a 1 to variable Count, and assigns 0 to variable Total, then asks you to input a string to variable Number, then while Count is more or equal than 10 it asks you to input Number again, adds Total and Number together in Total, then increments Count by 1. Then ends the while and outputs Total

---

```
WHILE Count <= -15
    DO
        INPUT Number
        Total = Total + 1
        Count = Count + 1
```

---

```
IF Number == 0
    THEN
        WRITE “This is a zero”
    ELIF Number > 0
        THEN
            WRITE “This is a positive number”
        ELSE
            WRITE “This is a negative number”
    ENDELIF
ENDIF

```

```IF Score = 3
    THEN
        OUTPUT “Won”
    ELIF Score = 1
        THEN 
            OUTPUT “DREW”
        ELSE
            OUTPUT “LOST”
    ENDELIF
ENDIF
```
