##Microprocessors:

###Interpreters:

This is teh first chunk of an IDE, it executes one line at a time, and when a error is found it stops running, it debugs each line bofore running.

###Compiler

Makes the code files (.c/.h/.py) into a executable with all the libraries and dependencies inside, also prints error after the run, and will hog the CPU so it better be an i7.
