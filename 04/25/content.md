---

A group of related parts that perform a specific task for a larger system. 

In programming, one sub-system or subroutine is normally represented by a small section of code within a program

How come Office software programs from Microsoft function similarly, like Access(left) and Excel (right), below?

Both are developed my Micro$oft Corp

*  Subroutine- A commonly used function that is available to a programmer
*  Library Routine - A short section of code within a program

How can we plan a system that consists of sub systems?

Subsystem = SystemUI, kernel, app loader, etc... AKA TopDown design

What data does a system require to calculate the number of hours an employee has worked for a company?

Hours worked, money/hour

###Subsystems

```
                                -----------
Customer Name >                 |         |
Customer Address >              |         |
Postcode >                      |         |
ItemID >                        | Machine |
Quantity >                      |         |
Price Per Item >                |         |
Total Payment Per Item >        |         |
Total Price = Price*Quantity >  |         |

The process of producing an algorithm by breaking down an overall task into smaller tasks is known as top-down design.
The process of breaking down large tasks into smaller tasks is referred to as decomposition.
To illustrate a breakdown of tasks and how tasks relate to one another, structure diagrams can be produced.
An individual section of the algorithm and part of program´s overall code is referred to as a module.
