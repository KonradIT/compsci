##Database questions

* What can happen to a db over time:

It grows larger, the filesize increases, the program struggles to manage it due to the large amounts of entries, and if some record change (moving house, etc...) it has to be reentered again.

A DB management solution is a program that enables the user to create/delete a DB, inserting/updating records, produce a meaningful graph... Examples such as the closed source Microsoft Access and the FOSS LibreOffice software "Base"

* Why queries?

Narrow down to not show male customers? Show all IDs that are born between 1999 and 2007?

* But why?

To show less data.

* How would the above query be set up if a user wishes to find the results below from the people table (tblPeople)?

Add a tblPeople in Table field.

* Advanced queries
