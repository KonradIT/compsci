##USB

* **What does it stand for:** Universal Serial Bus
* **Advantages:** Fast, reliable and can charge AND transfer data at the same time, and is portable.
* **Disadvantage:** easy to lose

##Parallel VS Serial

* **Difference:** 
  * Parallel: bits are sent on different channels and synced to a clock
  * Serial: bits are sent one by one

####Why not parallel:

* Multiple task at once can freeze the CPU

* Sending lots of data together can disrupt the connection
