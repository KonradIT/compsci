#Storage Devices

###Primary Storage:

Accessed by CPU, such as the RAM, and the ROM

* **ROM**: Stands for Read Only Memory, cannot be modififed, contains BIOS, its not a flashable ZIP of course. The BIOS controls the peripherical devices such as keyboard, mouse, drivers for GPU card, ...
* **RAM**: This storage device holds data temporarily unter the next reboot. If you have too much data being read/write to the RAM it can slow down significantly. And the RAM can be dedotated.

###Secondary Storage:

Accessed by humans.

* **SSD**: Fast to read/write, does not contain a disk. Data can be modified (r/w) and it does not delete itself on every boot. Commonly found in high end gaming PCs, such as mine. And, consumes less power.
* **HDD**: Slower to read/write compared to SSDs, it contains a disk inside.

###Next up... Disk space:

* **DVD-RAM**: it has concentric tracks unlike CDs and conventional DVDs which have spirals. Spirals allow for live rw.

* **CD/DVD**: It can be found in two formats: R (read only, for music disks) or RW (for data transmission from one computer **that still has a DVD slot** to another device **that still has a DVD slot**
