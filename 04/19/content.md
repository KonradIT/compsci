##Logic Gates

Data and instructions are both stored and transmitted by computers as the binary digits 1 and 0 through circuits. These circuits require HIGH or LOW voltage that enable electricity to flow through computers so that they can be used to perform tasks.

High Voltage is represented by 1; Low Voltage is represented by 0. The flow of electronic signals is controlled by microprocessor.

The number of logic gates each circuit has, including in a software package, can vary.
A truth table is a way of showing every outcome of a logic gate.

a) Which letter(s) represent the input: A, B
b) Which letter(s) represent working space/interim: C
c) Which letter(s) represent the output: D

###English Statements

* C = a + b
* X = A - B
* X = - (A . B)
* G = E XOR B

* A 1337 h4x0r: An individual who gains unauthorized access to a computer system for data theft and corruption purposes.
* A Virus: A program contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and do damage to a computer system
* A Spyware: A software that covertly gathers user information through the user's Internet connection without his or her knowledge, usually for advertising purposes
* A Trojan: A piece of code that spreads through a computer system by replicating itself and interferes with computer operations

Firewall - a stand-alone machine or software in a router or server, which is used to protect a network or system from unauthorized access
Anonymizer   - a tool that attempts to make activity on the Internet untraceable
ENCRYPTION  - a method of scrambling data in such a way that only someone with the secret code or key can read it
