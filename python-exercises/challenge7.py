THE CHASE

A quiz game comprising of random questions given to the player who competes with the chaser. When the player answers a question correctly, they move 1 space away from the computer (the chaser). When the chaser answers the question correctly, they move a step closer to the player. If the chaser catches the player, the player loses and the game is over.

Two ways to create your Python game version of The Chase:

1) Player and Chaser take it in turns to If the player reaches a finish line after a certain number of questions answered correctly, without being caught by the chaser, the player has won
